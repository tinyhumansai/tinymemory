//! Optional families that expose *derived structure* over stored memory:
//! [`MemoryEntities`], [`MemoryGraph`], and [`MemoryDiff`].
//!
//! Each is independently optional. A driver may have a key/value graph but no
//! entity index, or track source snapshots without either. The kernel filters
//! RPC registration and agent-tool assembly per family, so an absent family is
//! invisible rather than present-and-failing.
//!
//! As in [`crate::provider::content`], no configuration crosses this boundary:
//! extraction models, hotness decay curves, and snapshot retention are driver
//! concerns and appear in none of these signatures.

//! PDF and Office Open XML conversion (the `office` feature).
//!
//! [`crate::convert::NativeConverter`] handles what is already text. This is
//! the converter for the formats people actually drop into memory that are not
//! — a contract PDF, a spec `.docx`, a pricing `.xlsx`, a deck — so a host
//! does not have to bind an extractor of its own for them:
//!
//! ```
//! use tinymemory_documents::{ConverterChain, OfficeConverter};
//!
//! let chain = ConverterChain::default().prepend(Box::new(OfficeConverter));
//! ```
//!
//! | Format | Reader | Markdown it produces |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | PDF | `pdf-extract`, text layer only | the page text, whitespace-normalized |
//! | DOCX | `zip` + `quick-xml` over `word/document.xml` | one paragraph per `w:p` |
//! | PPTX | `zip` + `quick-xml` over `ppt/slides/slideN.xml` | slides in numeric order, one paragraph per `a:p` |
//! | XLSX | `calamine` | one `sheet \| cell \| cell` line per non-empty row |
//!
//! A spreadsheet is flattened rather than rebuilt as a table because that is
//! what recall can use: a chunk reading `Q3 | EMEA | 412000` answers a question
//! about EMEA revenue, and the same data as aligned columns does not survive
//! chunking.
//!
//! ## Hostile input
//!
//! [`crate::convert::MAX_DOCUMENT_BYTES`] caps the *compressed* upload, but an
//! Office file is a zip, and a small highly compressed part can expand without
//! limit. Every archive is therefore refused when the uncompressed sizes its
//! central directory declares sum past [`MAX_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES`] — checked
//! before any entry is read — and each entry read is capped as well, so an
//! archive that lies about its sizes cannot force the allocation either.
//!
//! A spreadsheet has one more: calamine materializes the dense bounding box of
//! a sheet's cells, so a tiny workbook with one cell at `A1` and one at
//! `XFD1048576` would allocate ~17 billion cells. The cells are scanned
//! sparsely first and a sheet whose box exceeds
//! [`MAX_SPREADSHEET_DENSE_CELLS`] is refused before that happens.
//!
//! `pdf-extract` panics on some malformed documents rather than erroring; the
//! panic is caught and reported as an unreadable document.
//!
//! ## Blocking work
//!
//! Parsing is CPU-bound and synchronous. The async
//! [`DocumentConverter::convert`] runs it inline, which is right for a
//! current-thread runtime or a small document; a host on a shared executor
//! calls [`OfficeConverter::convert_blocking`] from its own blocking pool
//! instead, and gets the same result.
